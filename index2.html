<!-- Docs: 

Some function that creates userChoice
User: 
  Either input directly with text, 
  dropdown,
  3 buttons signaling selection
Some function that generates a random computer choice

Some function to compare the choices to see who won

Some function to count/record the game state

While Loop Implementation Specs & Design: 

-> While Loop Condition: If either player has a score greater than 3.
-> Inside the while loop you're going to have the Computer selection run every loop. 
->You are also going to want to have the player selection prompt you to input every loop. 
-> Run the comparison against those values every loop. 
-> Update the scores
-> Check and see if there is a winner, if there is not a winner, continue the loop.
